## Machine learning on energy consumption

### Overview 
The study focuses on the development of a machine learning model for
forecasting the energy needs of Greece, while evaluating the adoption of the
renewable energy sources, electricity demand and carbon emissions.
Using the "International Energy Statistics" dataset from Kaggle, the
analysis includes a comparative overview of energy trends at a global level, including a comparative overview of energy trends at a global level.
level and especially in the G10 countries and the Balkans. The findings highlight the importance of
technological developments, government policies and economic
factors in the promotion of renewable energy sources.
To forecast energy needs, the Scikit-learn library was used, with
with emphasis on linear regression and other algorithms. Although the original
results showed a high deviation from the actual values, the study suggests the
importance of improving the models and incorporating additional data.
Overall, the research supports strategic energy planning, environmental planning, and environmental management.
environmental sustainability and energy security, providing valuable information on the
future energy needs of Greece.
